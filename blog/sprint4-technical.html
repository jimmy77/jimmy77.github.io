<h2>
    Got blocked on a simple problem
</h2>
  <p>
    Thinking back I recall struggling  a lot with setting up my blog. It felt like the hand holding had dropped away and all of a sudden I was just left to my own devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think I missed the familiar setup of question/ answer approach that freecodecamp was. With building my blog, there was no button to click to ‘Get a hint’.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recall feeling dread I felt and I remember feeling out of my depth during that process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily googling, taking breaks and lots of revising of freecodecamp lessons helped me get  there in the end. Using the dev tools in Google Chrome really helped alot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent a lot time using it trying to work out why elements were behaving in unexpected ways. Like working out where headings were inheriting their properties from and how to change that. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    The big lesson from the was, plan, plan plan. And then research, research. And don’t panic. 
  </p>
<h2>
    Solved a problem in an elegant way.
</h2>
  <p>
    Using CSS specificity to style elements in a particular page that was to appear different from another . I had paragraphs or body copy setup in black as a global style and figureed I'd alsk have black type appearing throughought my website on a white background.
  </p>
  <p>
    But ran into trouble when I decided to add some text inside my footer which had a black-ish background. 
    
    had a bit of text with a p tag sitting inside a footer with a dark ground 
  </p>
    
    
    realising it wasn’t legible.Luckily with a bit CSS specificity I managed to write a custom style that applied the colour white specifically to paragraph copy that appeared in the footer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I struggled with this and felt frustrated throughout the process. 
  </p>
  <p>
    But luckily help was only a couple of youtube’s and some reading away.
  </p>
  <p>
    The takeaway from that was, read and google and look around. The solution will generally be out there.
  </p>

<h2>
  In both cases:  
  What was the problem?
</h2>
<h2>
  What problem solving techniques did you use?
</h2>
<h2>
  How did you feel throughout the process?
</h2>
<h2>
  What did you learn?
</h2>
<h2>
  Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
</h2>

<p>    
  Pseudocode
  
  Trying something
  
  Rubber ducky method
  
  Reading error messages
  
  Console.logging
  
  Googling
  
  Asking your peers for help
  
  Asking coaches for help
  
  Improving your process with reflection
