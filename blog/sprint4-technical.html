<h2>
    Got blocked on a simple problem
</h2>
  <p>
    Thinking back I recall struggling  a lot with setting up my blog. It felt like the hand holding had dropped away and all of a sudden I was just left to my own devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think I missed the familiar setup of question/ answer approach that freecodecamp was. With building my blog, there was no button to click to ‘Get a hint’.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recall feeling dread I felt and I remember feeling out of my depth during that process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily googling, taking breaks and lots of revising of freecodecamp lessons helped me get  there in the end. Using the dev tools in Google Chrome really helped alot. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent a lot time using it trying to work out why elements were behaving in unexpected ways. Like working out where headings were inheriting their properties from and how to change that. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    The big lesson from the was, plan, plan plan. And then research, research. And don’t panic. 
  </p>
<h2>
    Solved a problem in an elegant way.
</h2>
  <p>
    So I had a bit of text in my footer  that was inheriting my global p tag style. By default it was black and I had intended for my body copy to appear on a white background.
  </p>
<p>
The problem arose when I need to add text to my footer that was going to need a p tag applied.
</p>
<p>
I struggled at first with find a solution.
</p>
<p>
Luckily help was only a couple of youtube’s and google searches away and I managed to work out that needed to apply some CSS specificity with my styles. I ended up writing footer specific p tag that made the text white so it was legible against the dark background of my footer.
</p>  
<p>
The takeaway from that was, read and google and look around. The solution will generally be out there.
</p>  

<h2>
  Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem<br> solving techniques and process:
</h2>
<h3>
  Pseudocode
</h3>
<p>
  For me, this technique is a must and it has really helped me out. I found myself bouncing a little between talking to an imaginary duck( the Rubber ducky method) before writing out some pseudocode.  For me, I like the idea of writing out in plain English how I’d approach solving a problem and then afterwards going through the pseudo code and swapping it out for actual code. That to me makes total sense and has helped me understand what I need to do to a degree.
</p>
<h3>
  Trying something
</h3>
<p>
  Definitely doing a lot of this in between writing pseudocode.
</p>
<h3>
  Rubber ducky method
</h3>
<p>
  Yep, this in conjunction with pseudo has helped me.
</p>
<h3>
  Reading error messages
</h3>
<p>
  Yes but definitely realise I need to do this more of especially after re-reading error messages and realising that I’m being literally told how to solve a problem.
</p>
<h3>
  Console.logging
</h3>
<p>
  Yes to this. I’ve found myself checking/outputting stuff to console.log to see if functions are working as they’re supposed to.
</p>
<h3>
Googling
</h3>
<p>
  Yes to this also which in turn has sent me on to youtube/Stack overflow, freecodecamp etc.
</p>
<h3>
  Asking your peers for help
</h3>
<p>
  Could probably do a lot more of this but I try to exhaust previous efforts before hitting other people up. 
</p>
<h3>
  Asking coaches for help
</h3>
<p>
  Yeah probably should reach out a bit more rather than later on this one.
</p>      
<h3>
  Improving your process with reflection
</h3>
<p>
  Yeah this one too I could with some more work on earlier as well. I’ve tried starting to use a journal at the start of everyday as of Wednesday to help clear my head and it does help.
