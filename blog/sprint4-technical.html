<h2>
  An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
</h2>
  <p>
    If you think of a house as a website then the house would be the frame, giving the house it’s form and support so you can fill the interior(with content). CSS is then the exterior cover of the house. There’s an almost limitless ways in which the outside of a house can be designed just as there are a myriad of ways that a CSS or style of a website can be applied.
  </p>
<h2>
  Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
</h2>
    <p>
      Control flow and  loops can be explained through the medium of travelling to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get to work there’s a list of things you need to do in a particular order before you can arrive at your work desk to begin your day.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The top of that list of things to do, getting out of bed, having breakfast and  having a shower would probably be the first thing to do before the next step of getting in your car to begin your commute.
    </p> 
    <p>
      The order of how this is done is pretty much like how control flow  works when it comes to javascript or a lot of coding languages for that matter. Tasks need to be done in sequence for code to be executed correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops would be the part where you repeatedly turn your key to start you car multiple times until it roars into life. Loops are events that repeat back on itself till a certain condition is met or satisfied at which point a looping instruction would stop.
    </p>
<h2>
  Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
</h2>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model or DOM is best though of as what lies beneath the html, css and javascript that’s on a webpage. It’s what binds them altogether. If you think of it like a cake DOM is the base layer.
    </p>
<h2>
  Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are actually objects. They behave kind of similarly but objects have the ability to store more information in them. They have the capability to be quite complex.
    </p>
      A general rule of thumb that I try to follow is that if you need to store a collection of properties of varying types, use an object. Otherwise, use an array.
    </p>
<h2>
  Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
</h2>
  <p>Functions  is a block of code designed to do a specific task. It’s activated when something invoke’s it(calls it). </p>
