<h3>
  What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
</h3>
  <p>
    I like the idea of building or creating apps or software that helps solve problems. I’m quite open to where that will lead me but I’d like to be involved in a role that utilises my skill set. If it involves some design input too as well then all the more better.
  </p>  
<h3>
  What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
</h3>
  <p>
    I think presenting has been a difficult skill for me. I’ve certainly shied away from public speaking in the past but I’d like to take more of an active role during this course to build on that as I see it as fairly critical skill when it comes to presenting work or projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of strengths I think, I’m hard-working, creative, lateral thinker. I’m good at both working by myself or within a team and I enjoying creating things.
<h3>
  What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h3>
  <p>
    Keeping on top of my workload. 
  </p>
<h3>
  What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h3>
  <p>
    Presenting’s always an area that I’ve shied away from but yeah that would be a great area I’d like more practise in.
  </p>
<h3>
  What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
</h3>
  <p>
    Being supportive and available to help me when I need it.
  </p>
<h3>
  What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
</h3>
  <p>
    To give all I have to Bootcamp. I’m bracing myself for the tempo of what it’s going to be like but I’d like to think with the new core skills I’ve developed I’ll be able to successfully complete it. 
  </p>

<h2>
  My learning plan
</h2>
<h3>
What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
</h3>
  <p>
    To be employed as a developer and working within the tech sector.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Better at dealing with conflict. Better at planning. Better at presenting and public speaking.
  </p>
<h3>
  A description of your own strengths and limitations
</h3>
  <p>
    My strengths are creativity, loyalty, empathy and curiosity. My limitations are I can struggle to make decisions. I can be too selfless and sometimes unrealistic and also struggle with time management.
  </p>
<h3>
  Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br>
</h3>
<h4>
  This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
</h4>
  <p>
    Breaking down tasks to be done into smaller manageable chunks and then assigning them to the upcoming week/calendar and checking on my progress daily against my expectations/planning.
  </p>
<h3>
  A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
</h3>
  <p>
    I’ll go through my tasks/requirements once I’ve worked out what I need to do ahead of time to determine whether or not I can foresee any issues and discuss with a facilitator.
  </p>
<h3>
  A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
</h3>
  <p>
    Assistance when I need it.
  </p>
<h3>
  Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
  For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
</h3>
  <p>
    I can’t leave the house before 7.30am because I need to be there for my children and I need to be home at least a few nights a week to see my children.
