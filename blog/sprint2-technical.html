    <h1>So you want to learn the difference between ID's and Classes</h1>
        
    <p>
      Basic tags like h2, p, strong and em can give your page structure but can only go so far in terms of styling.
      <br>For that, you need to use ID’s and Classes.
    </p>
    <p>ID and class selector’s give you a lot of options when defining the look and feel of a website.<br> 
      With them, you can to define your own set of custom selectors. 
    </p>
    <p>The key thing to keep in mind is that a class can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once. You should use classes for items that you know you're going to use a lot. 
      </p>
    <p>
        An example would be if you wanted to give all the paragraphs on your webpage the same styling, you would use classes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The benefit of this is that you can have the same HTML element, but present it differently depending on its class or ID.
    </p>
    <h2>Classes are NOT unique</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> You can use the same class on multiple elements.
        <li> You can use multiple classes on the same element.
      </ul>
