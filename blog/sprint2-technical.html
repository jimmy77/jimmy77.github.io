    <h1>So you what exactly is the difference between <br>"ID's" and "Classes"?</h1>

    <p> In the world of webpages, html tags help give structure to a website but are limited to how the content can be displayed.
      It can describe to a browser that a piece of information being shown is either a paragraph or a header, or that a word is bold or italicised.
    </p>
    <p>Basic tags like <span class="keywrd">h2</span>, <span class="keywrd">p</span>, <span class="keywrd">strong</span> 
      and <span class="keywrd">em</span> can give your page structure but can only show you text in black and with a standard system font.
    </p>
    <p>Creating an impactful webpage requires CSS selectors, and the <span class="keywrd">Class</span> and <span class="keywrd">ID</span> play a big role when it 
      comes to visually defining the content it displays.
    </p>

    <h2>Class's are NOT unique</h2> 
    <p>
       <ul>
         <li>You can use the same class on multiple elements</li>
         <li>You can use multiple classes on the same element</li>
       </ul> 

      <p>Classes are the workhorses of selectors and they do the general heavy-lifting when it comes to styling. In the CSS a class selector is a name that has a full stop before it.
        You should use classes for items that you know you're going to use a lot. 
      </p>
      <p>An example would be if you wanted to give all the paragraphs on your webpage the same styling, 
        you would use classes.
      </p>
      <p>Headlines would also be stylised in the same way. All H1’s will be the same, all H2’s 
        the same, callout boxes.
      </p>  

        A good rule of thumb I remember picking up from my design days was if there’s 2 or more elements that the same in terms of their heading levels, then you should apply class selector’s.
        
        The benefit of this is that you can have the same HTML element, but present it differently depending on its class or ID.
        
        IDs are unique
        * Each element can have only one id
        * Each page can have only one element with that id
        
        An ID selector appears in the CSS as a selector name with a hash character in front of it.
        
        The key difference between the two is that a “Class” can be applied multiple times to can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once. 
        

    </p>







    <p>
      Basic tags like <span class="monostyle">h2</span>, <span class="monostyle">p</span>, <span class="monostyle">strong</span> and <span class="monostyle">em</span> can give your page structure but can only go so far in terms of styling.
      For that, you need to use ID’s and Classes.
    </p>
    <p><span font-weight="strong">ID</span>'s and class selector’s give you a lot of options when defining the look and feel of a website.<br> 
      With them, you can to define your own set of custom selectors. 
    </p>
    <p>The key thing to keep in mind is that a class can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once. You should use classes for items that you know you're going to use a lot. 
      </p>

        An example would be if you wanted to give all the paragraphs on your webpage the same styling, you would use classes.

    <h2>Classes are NOT unique</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> You can use the same class on multiple elements.
        <li> You can use multiple classes on the same element.
