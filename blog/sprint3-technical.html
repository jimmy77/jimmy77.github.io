      So what exactly is the difference between ID's and Class'?
      </h1>

    <p>
      In the world of webpages, html tags help give structure to a website but are limited to how the content can be displayed.
      It can describe to a browser that a piece of information being shown is either a paragraph or a header, or that a word is bold or italicised.
      </p>
    <p>
      Basic tags like <span class="keywrd">h2</span>, <span class="keywrd">p</span>, <span class="keywrd">strong</span> 
      and <span class="keywrd">em</span> can give your page structure but can only show you text in black and with a standard system font.
      </p>
    <p>
      Creating an impactful webpage requires the use of CSS selectors of which <span class="keywrd">Class</span> and <span class="keywrd">ID</span> 
      selectors play a key part in visually defining onscreen content.
      </p>

    <h2>
      Classes are NOT unique
      </h2> 
    <p>
       <ul>
         <li>You can use the same class on multiple elements</li>
         <li>You can use multiple classes on the same element</li>
        </ul> 
     </p>
    <p>
      Classes are the workhorses of selectors and they do the general heavy-lifting when it comes to styling. In a CSS stylesheet, a class 
      selector is a name that has a full stop before it.  
      </p>
    <p>
        You should use classes for items that you know you're going to use a lot. 
        An example would be if you wanted to give all the paragraphs on your webpage the same styling, you would use classes.
      </p>
    <p>
      Headlines would also be stylised in the same way. All H1’s will be the same, all H2’s the same, callout boxes.
      </p>
    <p>
      A good rule of thumb I remember picking up from my design days was if there’s 2 or more elements that 
      the same in terms of their heading levels, then you should apply class selector’s.
      </p>   
    <p>
      The benefit of this is that you can have the same HTML element, but present it differently depending on its class or ID.

    <h2>IDs are unique</h2>
      <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each element can have only one id</li>
            <li>Each page can have only one element with that id</li>
            </ul>
        </p>  
    <p>
      An ID selector appears in the CSS as a selector name with a hash character in front of it.
      </p> 
    <p>
      The key difference between the two is that a “Class” can be applied multiple times to can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once.
