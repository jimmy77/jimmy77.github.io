    <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

      <p> intelligence is the ability to recognise within yourself what emotions you’re going through and how they’re affecting you as well as of those around you also.</p>
      
      <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      
      <p>An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived from several standardised tests designed to assess human intelligence whereas a EQ is more to do with an individual’ emotional intelligence.
         I’d say the latter is more important than the latter. Through my previous experience working in different companies, those with higher EQ’s generally did better than those without. IQ’s without EQ’s generally doesn’t do well.</p>
      
      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        
      <p>Apart from the reasons mention in the primer/challenge, stellar performance, outstanding leadership, happiness, being emotionally given today’s modern world and all the pressures that come with is incredibly challenging. 
      Work life, family life, mortgage repayments, studying. All these things add that extra dimension of pressure to life. 
      So being able to unpack all that and be okay takes effort and hard work. Some people blessed with the ability and lifestyle to not have to worry too much about that but they’re in the minority. </p>
      
      <p>Establishing and cultivating a good routine when it comes to emotion intelligence is incredibly beneficial.
      I’ve personally noticed a better sense of wellbeing myself from just taking time out to use the headspace app daily before I dive into my daily workload.
      It’s definitely made a world of difference for me when it comes to dealing with the challenges this coding journey’s throw my way.</p>
