          <h2>
            What are my values?
            </h2>
      
          <p>
             My core values are kindness/empathy, justice, fairness & equality, humour, family and creativity. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think a lot of my values were originally learned from my mother. She played the biggest role in my upbringing and she taught me her values of modesty, kindness, humility. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my sense of justice, fairness and equality stems from and informs my political leanings. I think that society is too neo-liberal at the moment and that’s far too much wealth disparity out there. I think easily empathise with those who are less fortunate as I myself was once like that also. Have experienced it first hand makes me realise that those in tough situations are to be helped not criticised.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also abhor corruption especially political corruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Family too for me is very important. I’ve learned to love and give selflessly as a parent.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.

          </h2>
          <p>
            I went for an advertising job interview several years ago and discovered that a key client was a big international tobacco company and that the role involved would be helping deliver tobacco advertisements.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember feeling super conflicted about the job and whether to take it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On the one hand I’d be earning a living and looking after my family while working in an extremely nice great office with great perks but on the other hand I’d be helping sell death in packs of 20. The choice was difficult. 
          </p>
          <p>
           I spent an age working out whether to take it or not but in the end I didn’t progress to the next candidate selection round so didn’t have to make the big decision. #bulletdodged

          <h2>
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I identify with two cultures - Fijian culture (I was born in Fiji) - and New Zealand culture (where I move when I was 10). Both have helped shape what I value and who I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Fijian culture prizes humility, community and hard work. New Zealand culture has shaped my humour, my belief in fairness and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some ways the cultures clash, but in other ways having grown up in two cultures has allowed me to see the world in a unique way, and has ultimately shaped who I am.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
          </h2>
          <p>
            My strengths are creativity, loyalty, empathy and curiosity. My limitations are I can struggle to make decisions. I can be too selfless and sometimes unrealistic and also struggle with time management.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
          </h2>
          <p>
            Curiosity helps me as I’m always keen to learn new things and my creativity means I can look at things in fresh ways that others might not have thought of. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My loyalty and empathy mean I’m valuable in a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I need to work on my decision making skills. At times, I can be so indecisive that results in paralysis and holds me back. I also need to check myself on whether my goals and timeframes are realistic. I also need to work on thinking more about what is best for me as opposed to always thinking about making other people comfortable.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
          </h2>
          <p>
            My curiosity and creativity will help me push me along and keep me interested but I’ll need to be careful to make realistic planning a part of my learning.
          </p>
          <h2> 
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I had a friend as a client. He didn’t understand the amount of skill or hours needed to complete the job for him. He tried to talk down the cost and then began planning a second project, assuming a low price. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to gently talk to him about what was involved and that the prices were not realistic - even at mate’s rates - but I didn’t get through.
          </p>
          <p>
            I finished the first job but avoided encouraging him to give me the second job.
          </p>
          <p>
            In hindsight, I could have had a more honest conversation with him about his expectations versus mine, so he knew where I stood and could then make the decision as to whether or not he wanted me to do the second job.
