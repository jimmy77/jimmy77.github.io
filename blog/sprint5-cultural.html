  <h2>
    What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
  </h2>
<p>
  That despite being frustrated with learning at such a rapid pace, I can still adapt and overcome. I’ve attempted learning programming before off my own effort but with mixed results. Adopting a growth mindset has helped me see any struggles I experience not as a failure and an end but as just a temporary stop, a ‘not yet’ to paraphrase Carol Dweck.
</p>
<p>
  Also, that I have more patience and capacity to learn programming than I thought I had. Prior to this I experienced a lot of self-doubt, particularly given my ADHD condition.  I was convinced that it was because of that that wouldn’t have been able to actually fulfil a dream of mine of being a developer. But but by using the Pomodoro technique, I could do it and just need to manage my approach to how I learned. Breaking down tasks into smaller manageable chunks makes sense but applying that also to my learning approach has helped immensely.
</p>
<p>
  Learning to work with others when it came to programming was interesting. I initially was a little anxious about potential skill differences, in particular I imagined myself the weaker of the pair but found that at the end of the day it’s really about seeing passed that and making the best of the situation.
</p> 
<h2>
  What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
</h2>
<p>
  That it was exceptionally helpful in not just with coding but in life in general. I think the scepticism on my part was with how much of a role exactly would it have with coding. At first I thought, “Sure yoga to shake off the tension sounds like a good idea but why so much time spent on this “core” thing” but as time progressed I honestly realise the stuff that’s covered are incredibly helpful to get through the material. 
</p>
<h2>
  What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
</h2> 
<p>
The reflecting and the introspection and sharing.  It’s one thing to be honest with yourself but to then open up and share with others was daunting at first but became easier as time went on.
</p>   
<h2>
  Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
</h2>  
<p>
  I can see there’s a lot to take in with learning the new programming languages. It can make the journey quite frustrating and anxiety inducing.
</p>
<p>
  The core learning aspect of the programme helps provide you with tools to work through and deal with those frustrations and to help promote growth and empathy.
</p>
<h2>
  Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
</h2>
<p>
  Honestly, it’s hands down been an amazing journey so far. It has been pretty empowering to help on not just my coding journey but through life.
</p>  
<p>
  I’ve found that just learning about learning has been a revelation. The Pomodoro technique has been so super helpful for me as someone with ADHD I’ve struggled with the idea that perhaps programming just wasn’t for me. But going through the core learning module has made me realise that it was really of adapting my approach to learning and that an orthodox approach isn’t for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  Carol Dwek’s growth mindset stuff has been super insightful too. The ‘not yet’ concept really did open me up to the realisation that failing once or twice was just a ‘not yet’ complete moment rather than a failure.
