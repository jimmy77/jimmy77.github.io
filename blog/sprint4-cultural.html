      Neuroplasticity 
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
  </h2>
    <p>
      Prior the developments and discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity it was accepted in the neurosciences that certain functions were hard-wired in specific regions of the brain and that any incidents of brain change or recovery were exceptions to the rule.  But since the late 70s  and 80s we’ve learned that the brain can change and adapt to new experiences and abilities contrary to what we understood earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now know that  different experiences and situations stimulate the brain to form create new neural paths and branches and that repeated exposure to those same experiences help strengthen those connections. But just as they can be formed they can also be undone. Synapse’s that aren’t stimulated by the same experience whither and are eliminated in a process called synaptic pruning. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With what we’ve now learned, pursing and learning new skills should be embraced. The brain is essentially like a muscle in that it can be taught new things and strengthen when used repeatedly. This is pretty pertinent given the new skill we’re learning at this course can be learned in time through repeated exposure and practise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly there are 4 types of neuroplasticity. Homologous area adaptation, compensatory masquerade, cross-modal reassignment and map expansion.
      Map expansion is the fourth type of neuroplasticity that involves flexibility of local brain regions that are dedicated to performing one type of function or storing a particular form of information. This the type of neuroplasticity that’s exercised when learning a new skill.
    </p>
  
<h2>
  Discuss you how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity<br>for your own benefit
</h2>
  <p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Practise</li>
      <li>Practise</li>
      <li>Practise</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  <p>
    And lots of it. Leveraging the idea that repeated exposure to and doing coding will help me grow in this area. 
  </p> 
  
<h2>
  What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
</h2> 
  <p>
    Constant practise daily for a minimum of at least an hour of coding skills. I still use the Pomodoro technique/approach so as not to exhaust my attention span and to keep me fired up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keeping a list of area’s that I’m aware of that I’m not too crash hot at it and pushing myself to face it. Admittedly with this new about face on how I deal with challenges does make it a lot easier to do.
  </p>

<h1>
  Growth Mindset
</h1>
<h2>
  Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
</h2>
  <p>
    Adopting a growth mindset is an understanding that you can build abilities and talent through hard work and dedication. That failure doens't necessarily mean the end but just a temporary stop.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s particularly insightul I found for this and the earlier when we started tackling Javascript. I found HTML and CSS much easier than JS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now armed with a growth mindset, I’ve learned to not “fear the code” and to dive into it. To accept the mistakes and the fails of which there’s many.
  </p>
  <p>
    And seeing as there’s a multitude more of mistakes and growth further down this path, approaching this with a growth mindset makes me feel more confident. Like it validates my hard work and dedication will pay off. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking back already to sprint 1, I feel like I’ve in a way already applied a growth mindset but just didn’t realise I was doing it. I’m already a better person and coder compared to earlier self before I even started with Dev Academy and it’s a testament 
    to having a GM approach. 
  </p>

<h2>
  In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
</h2>
  <p>
    Absolutely. It had a fundamental change on my approach to problems. Just realising that the thought of solving a problem was already creating new neural pathways was a revelation into how powerful thoughts and the imagination are.
  </p>
  <p>  
    I think I didn’t realise how much I feared change and making mistakes until learning about a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset. In coding and in life, but just through the realisation that just merely the act of  embracing and facing challenges head my ability to learn coding. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Also, realising that cultivating a growth mindset can help to develop a more calm approach to tackling a challenge and to not fear failure or the possibility of failure but to rather see it as a learning opportunity to grow from.
  </p>
  <p> 
    I feel my approach to code has been given a boost as I realise now that even attempting the work will have a positive effect on my mind and thinking and it has definitely lifted my confidence.  Timely really given the mental load that javascript has turned out to be.
  </p>
 
<h2>
  How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
</h2>

  <p> 
    I think that just being aware of how much of a positive impact having a growth mindset can have, is pretty motivating in itself. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    Since learning that, I’ve definitely developed less of a fear of javascript and of making mistakes. I’m much more inclined now to persevere with solving a problem knowing that even just persisting helps too.
  </p>
  <p> 
   For me and my continuing journey into code, I’ll be upping my practise and try to keep in mind that failure isn’t failure but just something I’ve not mastered yet. 
    I’ve come to realise and appreciate now, how the power of one’s beliefs can literally shape your thinking.
