      Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset

  <h3>
    Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
  </h3>
  <p>
    So prior the developments and discoveries in the field of neuroplasticity it was accepted in the neurosciences that certain functions were hard-wired in specific regions of the brain and that any incidents of brain change or recovery were exceptions to the rule.  But since the late 70s  and 80s we’ve learned that the brain can change and adapt to new experiences and abilities contrary to what we understood earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now know that  different experiences and situations stimulate the brain to form create new neural paths and branches and that repeated exposure to those same experiences help strengthen those connections. But just as they can be formed they can also be undone. Synapse’s that aren’t stimulated by the same experience whither and are eliminated in a process called synaptic pruning. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With what we’ve now learned, pursing and learning new skills should be embraced. The brain is essentially like a muscle in that it can be taught new things and strengthen when used repeatedly. This is pretty pertinent given the new skill we’re learning at this course can be learned in time through repeated exposure and practise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interestingly there are 4 types of neuroplasticity. Homologous area adaptation, compensatory masquerade, cross-modal reassignment and map expansion.
    Map expansion is the fourth type of neuroplasticity that involves flexibility of local brain regions that are dedicated to performing one type of function or storing a particular form of information. This the type of neuroplasticity that’s exercised when learning a new skill.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Discuss you how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
  </h3>
  <p>
    Practise. Lots of it. Leveraging the idea that repeated exposure to and doing coding will help me grow in this area. 
  </p> 
  <h3>
    What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
  </h3> 
  <p> 
    Practise, practise, practise. Constant practise daily for a minimum of at least an hour of coding skills. I still use the Pomodoro technique/approach so as not to exhaust my attention span and to keep me fired up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keeping a list of area’s that I’m aware of that I’m not too crash hot at it and pushing myself to face it. Admittedly with this new about face on how I deal with challenges does make it a lot easier to do.
